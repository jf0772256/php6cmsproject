###ADMIN Partial File###
Since the site will only use 1 page, and will include and interact with the database with the admin partials rather than wholey seperate pages
This is what I believe is called a MVC setup... The view is the index, model is Admin, and the partials are the parts of the page that make up the dashboard.

This is the next major portion of the project.
