###
### The intent of the PHP6 file is to work on creating a controller and user
### access page from php, This will connect to the database and create tables
### as needed and then fill them with data later.

### this project uses models and the database is controlled completely from one
### database.php :)
### tables.php is where tables are defined and created, this file is run when the page is loaded, only if the tables are not
### generated will it do anything though, this file can be found in 'database/tables.php'.
